Vulnerability discovery is an integral part of any security assessment. While we prefer manual, 
specialized tasks that leverage our knowledge and experience during a security audit, automated 
vulnerability scanners are nonetheless invaluable when used in proper context. In this module, we 
will provide an overview of automated vulnerability scanning, discuss its various considerations, 
and focus on both Nessus and Nmap as indispensable tools.
Vulnerability scanner implementations vary, but generally follow a standard workflow.

Most automated scanners will:

1. Detect if a target is up and running.
2. Conduct a full or partial port scan, depending on the configuration.
3. Identify the operating system using common fingerprinting techniques.
4. Attempt to identify running services with common techniques such as banner grabbing, service behavior identification, or file discovery.
5. Execute a signature-matching process to discover vulnerabilities

Nessus
**This is an automated tool and is run by this commmand.**

`sudo /etc/init.d/nessusd start`

##### or

`systemctl start nessusd`

Once Nessus is running, we can launch a browser and navigate to https://localhost:8834. We will
be presented with a certificate error indicating an unknown certificate issuer, but this is expected
due to the use of a self-signed certificate.


#### Nessus supports a number of scan types, including:
* Basic Network Scan: Generic scan with various checks that are suitable to be used against
various target types.
* Credentialed Patch Audit: Authenticated scan that enumerates missing patches.
* Web Application Tests: Specialized scan for discovering published vulnerabilities in Web
Applications.
* Spectre and Meltdown: Targeted scan for the Spectre 231 and Meltdown 232 vulnerabilities.
We recommend investigating these scan types, but for this introductory section, we will focus on a
standard, basic network scan, which we can launch by clicking on Basic Network Scan.
