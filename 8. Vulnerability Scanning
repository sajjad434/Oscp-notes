Vulnerability discovery is an integral part of any security assessment. While we prefer manual, 
specialized tasks that leverage our knowledge and experience during a security audit, automated 
vulnerability scanners are nonetheless invaluable when used in proper context. In this module, we 
will provide an overview of automated vulnerability scanning, discuss its various considerations, 
and focus on both Nessus and Nmap as indispensable tools.
Vulnerability scanner implementations vary, but generally follow a standard workflow.

Most automated scanners will:

1. Detect if a target is up and running.
2. Conduct a full or partial port scan, depending on the configuration.
3. Identify the operating system using common fingerprinting techniques.
4. Attempt to identify running services with common techniques such as banner grabbing, service behavior identification, or file discovery.
5. Execute a signature-matching process to discover vulnerabilities
